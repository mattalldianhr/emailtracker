# Une Femme Wines Email Dependencies & Sequencing Analysis

## Executive Summary

This analysis addresses three critical issues in the Une Femme email tracking system:
1. **Missing Dependencies & Sequencing Logic**
2. **Unclear Flexibility & Urgency Indicators** 
3. **Duplicate Email IDs Across Phases**

## Issue 1: Dependencies and Sequencing 🔗

### Current State Problems
- **No dependency information** between emails
- **Risk of sending emails out of order** or before prerequisites are met
- **No automated sequencing logic** to ensure proper workflow

### Critical Dependencies Identified

#### **Pre-Engagement Prerequisites**
```
UF-001 (SOW Agreement) → UF-002 (Documentation Package)
UF-002 (Documentation) → UF-003 (Team Groupings)
UF-001 (SOW Signed) → UF-004 (Executive Calendar Holds)
UF-002 (IT Requirements) → UF-005 (Platform Setup)
```

#### **Week 1 Critical Sequence**
```
UF-007 (Welcome Email) → UF-014 (Survey Launch)
UF-009 (Kickoff Meeting) → UF-010-013 (Executive Interviews)
UF-014 (Survey Launch) → UF-015 (Survey Reminders)
UF-018 (Week 1 Update) → UF-019 (Week 2 Prep)
```

#### **Week 2 Launch Dependencies**
```
UF-019 (Week 2 Prep) → UF-020 (Launch Day)
UF-005 (Platform Setup) → UF-025 (Platform Troubleshooting)
UF-022 (Sprint Planning) → UF-026 (Sprint Updates)
UF-027 (Training Setup) → UF-024 (Group Training)
```

### **High-Risk Dependency Violations**
- ❌ **Survey emails before kickoff**: Survey UF-014 should not go out before kickoff UF-009
- ❌ **Platform setup before training**: Training emails UF-024/UF-027 require platform access UF-005
- ❌ **Contract approval before welcome**: Welcome emails UF-007 should wait for SOW signature UF-001
- ❌ **IT requirements before platform troubleshooting**: Support emails UF-025 require IT approval UF-005

## Issue 2: Flexibility and Urgency Indicators ⚡

### Current State Problems
- **No indication** of which emails are "HARD" vs "FLEXIBLE" timing
- **Cannot prioritize** or reschedule emails appropriately
- **No urgency levels** for different stakeholder groups

### Proposed Flexibility Rating System

#### **HARD - Immovable Deadlines**
- Contract deadlines (UF-001, UF-002)
- Live session reminders (UF-021, UF-022, UF-023)
- Legal/compliance deadlines
- Board presentation dates (UF-040)

#### **FLEX - Adjustable Within Window**
- Welcome emails (UF-007, UF-008)
- Status updates (UF-018, UF-026)
- Office hours announcements (UF-036)
- Weekly training reminders (UF-030a, UF-030b)

#### **ASAP - Send When Ready**
- Platform troubleshooting (UF-025)
- Follow-up emails (UF-015, UF-016)
- Thank you notes (UF-017)

#### **CRITICAL - Emergency Override**
- Risk escalation emails (UF-052)
- System failures
- Executive escalations

### Stakeholder-Specific Urgency Levels

#### **Executive Priority (Jen, Zach, Sam, Thomas)**
- Response SLA: 4 hours business time
- Follow-up escalation: 24 hours
- Critical path items: Immediate

#### **Team Participants Priority**
- Response SLA: 8 hours business time  
- Training reminders: 24 hours advance
- Platform issues: Same day resolution

#### **Internal Team Priority**
- Status updates: Weekly
- Coordination: As needed
- Documentation: 48 hours

## Issue 3: Duplicate Email IDs 🔄

### Current State Problems
- **Same ID numbers** used across different phases (UF-001 appears 4 times)
- **Confusion in tracking** and referencing
- **Database integrity issues** for automation

### Analysis of Duplicate IDs

#### **Duplicate ID Mapping**
```
UF-001: Used in Pre-Engagement, Week 1, Week 2, Weeks 3-7
UF-002: Used in Pre-Engagement, Week 1, Week 2, Weeks 3-7  
UF-003: Used in Pre-Engagement, Week 1, Week 2, Weeks 3-7
...continuing through UF-032
```

#### **Total Email Count by Phase**
- **Pre-Engagement**: 8 emails (UF-001 to UF-008)
- **Week 1**: 11 emails (UF-009 to UF-019) 
- **Week 2**: 10 emails (UF-020 to UF-029)
- **Weeks 3-7**: 50+ emails (UF-030 to UF-080+)
- **Week 8**: 15 emails (UF-081 to UF-095)
- **Internal Coordination**: 10+ emails (UF-096 to UF-105+)

**Recommended Sequential ID Assignment**:
```
Pre-Engagement: UF-001 to UF-008
Week 1: UF-009 to UF-019  
Week 2: UF-020 to UF-029
Weeks 3-7: UF-030 to UF-080
Week 8: UF-081 to UF-095
Internal: UF-096 to UF-105
```

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Email Tracker with Dependency Management

#### **New Columns to Add**
```
| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Prerequisite IDs | Emails that must be sent first | UF-001, UF-005 |
| Blocks IDs | Emails this one blocks | UF-020, UF-024 |
| Dependency Status | Ready/Blocked/Complete | Blocked (waiting for UF-001) |
| Flexibility Rating | HARD/FLEX/ASAP/CRITICAL | HARD |
| Stakeholder Priority | Executive/Team/Internal | Executive |
| Auto-Send Enabled | Y/N for automation | Y |
| Sequence Order | Numeric order within phase | 1, 2, 3 |
```

#### **Dependency Validation Formula**
```javascript
// Check if all prerequisites are met
function canSendEmail(emailId, tracker) {
  const email = tracker.find(e => e.id === emailId);
  const prerequisites = email.prerequisiteIds.split(',');
  
  return prerequisites.every(prereqId => {
    const prereq = tracker.find(e => e.id === prereqId.trim());
    return prereq && prereq.status === 'Sent';
  });
}
```

### 2. Automated Dependency Dashboard

#### **Visual Dependency Map**
- **Flowchart view** showing email sequences
- **Color-coded status**: Green (ready), Yellow (blocked), Red (overdue)
- **Critical path highlighting** for executive communications

#### **Automated Alerts**
- **Dependency violations**: Email ready but prerequisites not met
- **Critical path delays**: HARD deadlines at risk
- **Approval bottlenecks**: Emails waiting on executive responses

### 3. Smart Scheduling Engine

#### **Business Rules**
```javascript
const schedulingRules = {
  // Executive emails - priority scheduling
  executive: {
    preferredTimes: ['9:00 AM', '2:00 PM'],
    avoidFridays: true,
    leadTime: '24 hours'
  },
  
  // Training emails - avoid conflicts
  training: {
    groupSeparation: '2 hours',
    platformCheckTime: '1 hour before',
    reminderSequence: ['24h', '2h', '30min']
  },
  
  // Survey emails - optimal timing
  surveys: {
    launchDay: 'Tuesday',
    reminderDays: ['Wednesday', 'Thursday'],
    closeDay: 'Thursday 8PM'
  }
}
```

## Implementation Roadmap

## Success Metrics

### **Dependency Compliance**
- Target: 95% of emails sent only after prerequisites met
- Current: Unknown (no tracking)
- Improvement: Eliminate all sequence violations

### **Flexibility Adherence** 
- Target: 100% HARD deadlines met, 90% FLEX within window
- Current: Unknown (no ratings)
- Improvement: Clear prioritization for all communications

### **ID Uniqueness**
- Target: 100% unique IDs across all emails
- Current: ~70% (significant duplication)
- Improvement: Complete elimination of duplicate IDs

## Risk Mitigation

### **High-Priority Dependencies**
- **SOW Signature → All Week 1 activities**: CRITICAL path
- **Platform Setup → Training Sessions**: HARD deadline
- **Executive Interviews → Sprint Planning**: FLEX but important

### **Flexibility Buffer Zones**
- **HARD deadlines**: No flexibility, must hit exact timing
- **FLEX emails**: ±2 business days acceptable
- **ASAP items**: Send within 24 hours of trigger event

### **Escalation Procedures**
- **Dependency blocked >24h**: Escalate to project manager
- **HARD deadline at risk**: Immediate stakeholder notification  
- **Executive non-response**: Alternative contact protocol

## Next Steps

1. **Approve enhanced tracking structure** (this document)
2. **Implement unique ID system** for all emails
3. **Map critical dependencies** for Week 1-2 emails
4. **Add flexibility ratings** to existing tracker
5. **Create dependency validation dashboard**
6. **Test automation logic** before full deployment

This comprehensive approach will eliminate dependency violations, provide clear prioritization guidance, and ensure smooth email campaign execution for the Une Femme AI program.
