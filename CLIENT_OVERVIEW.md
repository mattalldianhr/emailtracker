## **Client Overview \- Happy Robots and Une Femme Wines**

### **About Une Femme**

Une Femme is the **\#2 fastest-growing canned wine brand in the US**, experiencing 140% YOY growth in Q1 2025\. They're positioned to deplete over 320k cases this year, making them the second-largest canned wine brand in the RNDC portfolio (behind Underwood/Union Wine Co.). Founded by Jen Pelka and Zach Pelka with fine dining roots, they've built a premium canned wine brand focused on quality and freshness. They've successfully raised multiple oversubscribed funding rounds (often in \<24 hours) and are positioning for Series B or strategic exit. Recent innovations include still wines (Unoaked Chardonnay, Red Blend) and kegs for high-volume hospitality venues.

**Key Differentiators:**

* Only canned wine brand producing fresh product monthly using Just In Time manufacturing (20-40k cases/month)  
* 100% Certified Sustainable wines from single-varietal California vineyards (Napa, Sonoma, Lodi)  
* Focus on benchmark California varietals: Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon  
* Premium positioning with roots in fine dining (Daniel Boulud, Thomas Keller)  
* Award-winning winemaker Evyn Cameron ("Winemaker to Watch" & "Top 100")  
* Leading the Canned Wine Consortium on freshness science with Cornell University

**Major Partnerships:**

* **Delta Air Lines**: Full ownership of wine program across domestic/international flights  
* **Hospitality**: Neiman Marcus, Virgin Voyages, Marriott Vacation Clubs, Hilton Grand Vacations, Walt Disney World, Levy Arenas & Stadiums, Blue Origin (Jeff Bezos' space missions)  
* **Distribution**: Nationally aligned with RNDC ($10M+ annual revenue contribution)

### **Why Are We Here?**

Une Femme Wines is fully bought into the power of AI, and sincerely believe that adoption is a MUST for them and their team. They are at a critical growth inflection point (140% YOY growth, targeting 600k+ cases within 2 years) with several strategic challenges that AI can address:

1. **Distributor Management**: Despite being a priority brand for RNDC, execution lags expectations. AI can help optimize communication, tracking, and accountability systems.

2. **Sales Generation**: Automation of sample sending, cold outreach to new potential routes etc.

3. **New Vineyard Ideation:** Helping the team imagine, build out and explore new opportunities for a vineyard they are about to purchase in Sonoma Valley.

4. **Brand Evolution**: Currently repositioning from "serious" to "fun" with new agencies (The James Collective, Serafina). AI can accelerate content creation and brand consistency.

5. **Operational Efficiency**: Strong track record of lean operations, but looking to scale without proportional headcount increases.

6. **Market Expansion**: Limited off-premise presence in retail chains and independents \- AI can help identify and prioritize opportunities. Note: DTC was tested but wasn't profitable; focus remains on B2B channels.

## **Final Notes**

This is a **beta pilot** designed to demonstrate rapid value for Une Femme as they scale from 320k to potentially 600k+ cases. The compressed timeline and parallel phases are intentional to show immediate impact on their most pressing challenges: distributor management, demand forecasting, and brand evolution.

Key success factors:

1. **Flawless Week 2 execution** \- All hands on deck  
2. **Clear expectations** \- Client knows this is accelerated pilot  
3. **Industry-specific solutions** \- Focus on wine/CPG applications  
4. **Quick wins** \- Target distributor tracking or demand forecasting for sprint  
5. **Phase 2 opportunity** \- Contextualize phase for full implementation

Remember: This is "friends and family" pricing with significant discounts. Une Femme has demonstrated exceptional operational discipline (99.8% forecast accuracy, 0.36% error rate) \- they'll expect the same from us. All communications should go through **Zach Pelka** as the primary POC.
