# Une Femme Wines - Email Dependencies & Flexibility Analysis

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED:** The current email communications plan lacks proper dependency mapping and flexibility indicators, creating significant risk of sending emails out of sequence or missing critical timing requirements.

## Current State Problems

### ‚ùå **Missing Flexibility Classifications**
- No "HARD" vs "FLEXIBLE" timing indicators
- Cannot distinguish between moveable and unmoveable deadlines
- Risk of rescheduling critical path items inappropriately

### ‚ùå **No Dependency Mapping**
- Emails could be sent before prerequisites are met
- No clear sequencing logic between related communications
- Risk of confusion or premature communications

## SOLUTION: Comprehensive Dependency & Flexibility Framework

---

## 1. FLEXIBILITY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM

### **HARD DEADLINES** üî¥
Cannot be moved without significant project impact
- **Contract signatures and SOW approvals**
- **Kickoff meetings and launch events** 
- **Platform setup requirements (before training)**
- **Executive presentations to board/stakeholders**
- **Survey deadlines (analysis dependency)**

### **FLEXIBLE DEADLINES** üü°
Can be adjusted within reason (¬±1-2 days)
- **Individual training sessions**
- **Follow-up emails**
- **Status updates**
- **Resource distribution**
- **Office hours announcements**

### **ASAP/URGENT** üî•
Immediate action required, typically <24 hours
- **Platform troubleshooting**
- **Risk escalations**
- **Critical client issues**
- **Day-of-event reminders**

## 3. RECOMMENDED EMAIL CLASSIFICATION

### **HARD DEADLINE EMAILS (Cannot be moved)**

| Email ID | Subject | Dependency | Business Impact if Delayed |
|----------|---------|------------|---------------------------|
| UF-001 | Agreement Follow-up | Project start | Contract delays, SOW signature |
| UF-002 | Documentation Package | UF-001 | All subsequent approvals blocked |
| UF-005 | IT Requirements | UF-002 | Platform access failure, training delays |
| UF-009 | Kickoff Reminder | Project launch | Meeting attendance, team confusion |
| UF-014 | Survey Launch | Kickoff complete | Analysis timeline, Week 2 planning |
| UF-020 | Launch Day | Week 2 start | Training schedule, sprint timeline |
| UF-021 | Executive Findings | Survey analysis | Decision-making, sprint direction |
| UF-028 | Demo Day | Sprint complete | Stakeholder confidence, ROI demonstration |
| UF-038 | Final Week Kickoff | Week 8 start | Program completion, certification |
| UF-040 | Executive Results | Program complete | ROI validation, Phase 2 approval |

### **FLEXIBLE DEADLINE EMAILS (Can adjust ¬±1-2 days)**

| Email ID | Subject | Flexibility Window | Adjustment Impact |
|----------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| UF-015/016 | Survey Reminders | ¬±1 day | Minimal - extends deadline |
| UF-030a/b | Training Reminders | ¬±2 days | Low - reschedule session |
| UF-031 | Homework Feedback | ¬±3 days | Low - individual pace |
| UF-032+ | Executive Coaching | ¬±1 week | Medium - personal schedules |
| UF-035+ | Success Stories | ¬±1 week | Low - content timing |
| UF-036+ | Office Hours | ¬±2 days | Low - optional attendance |

### **ASAP/URGENT EMAILS (Immediate action required)**

## 4. DEPENDENCY VIOLATION RISKS

### **High-Risk Scenarios**
1. **Survey sent before kickoff** ‚Üí Confusion about program scope
2. **Training scheduled before platform access** ‚Üí Session failure
3. **Demo announced before sprint completion** ‚Üí Credibility loss
4. **Executive coaching before findings** ‚Üí Misaligned priorities

## 5. IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### **Immediate Actions**

1. **Add Flexibility Column to Email Tracker**
   - Values: HARD, FLEX, ASAP
   - Color coding: Red, Yellow, Orange

2. **Add Dependencies Column**
   - Format: "UF-001, UF-002" (blocking emails)
   - Validation: Cannot send until dependencies complete

3. **Create Dependency Dashboard**
   - Visual timeline showing critical path
   - Alerts for dependency violations
   - Flexibility buffers highlighted

### **Code Implementation**

Update the Google Sheets tracker to include:

```javascript
// Add to Email Tracker columns
"Flexibility": ["HARD", "FLEX", "ASAP"],
"Dependencies": "UF-001, UF-005", // Comma-separated blocking IDs
"Earliest Send Date": "=MAX(dependency completion dates)",
"Latest Send Date": "=IF(Flexibility='HARD', Target Date, Target Date + buffer)"
```

### **Process Changes**

1. **Weekly Dependency Review**
   - Check all HARD deadlines for the coming week
   - Identify potential conflicts or risks
   - Adjust FLEX items to accommodate HARD items

2. **Daily Critical Path Check**
   - Review today's HARD deadline emails
   - Confirm all dependencies are complete
   - Flag any at-risk communications

3. **Emergency Escalation Protocol**
   - ASAP emails trigger immediate team notification
   - HARD deadline risks escalate to project manager
   - Client communication for any critical path delays

## 6. SUCCESS METRICS

### **Dependency Management KPIs**
- **0% emails sent before dependencies complete**
- **95%+ HARD deadlines met on time**
- **<2 days average delay for FLEX items**
- **<1 hour response time for ASAP issues**

### **Risk Reduction Metrics**
- **100% pre-send dependency validation**
- **Weekly critical path reviews completed**
- **All team members trained on dependency checking**

## CONCLUSION

Implementing this dependency and flexibility framework will:

‚úÖ **Eliminate sequencing errors** that could confuse or frustrate the client  
‚úÖ **Enable intelligent rescheduling** when conflicts arise  
‚úÖ **Improve team coordination** through clear priority signals  
‚úÖ **Reduce project risk** by protecting critical path items  
‚úÖ **Enhance client experience** through properly timed communications  

**Next Steps:**
1. Update email tracker with flexibility and dependency columns
2. Classify all 50+ emails using this framework
3. Train team on dependency checking process
4. Implement weekly critical path reviews

This system transforms the email communications from an ad-hoc list into a properly sequenced, risk-managed project communication plan.
