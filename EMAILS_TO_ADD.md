**Content:**
```
Subject: ‚úÖ Feedback on Your Module 1 Prompts

Hi Sara,

Thanks for submitting your Module 1 homework. Your prompts for financial forecasting were excellent!

**Feedback & Suggestions:**

**Prompt 1: "Forecast Q3 revenue"**
‚Ä¢ **What Worked:** Clear and direct.
‚Ä¢ **Suggestion:** Add more context for better results. Try: "Acting as a financial analyst for a fast-growing wine company, forecast Q3 revenue based on the attached sales data (Q1-Q2 2024), considering a 15% summer seasonal lift and a new partnership with Delta launching in July."

**Prompt 2: "Analyze budget variance"**
‚Ä¢ **What Worked:** Good use of a specific term.
‚Ä¢ **Suggestion:** Specify the format for the output. Try adding: "...present the results in a markdown table with columns for Budget, Actual, Variance $, and Variance %."

**Prompt 3: "Explain compliance costs"**
‚Ä¢ **What Worked:** Great, open-ended question for exploration.
‚Ä¢ **Suggestion:** To make it more actionable, add a role. "Explain the main drivers of compliance costs to a new board member who is unfamiliar with the wine industry."

Overall, fantastic start. You're already thinking like a prompt engineer!

Let me know if you have any questions. See you in the next session!

Best,
Aaron

Subject: ‚úÖ Feedback on Your Module 1 Prompts

Hi Sara,

Thanks for submitting your Module 1 homework. Your prompts for financial forecasting were excellent!

**Feedback & Suggestions:**

**Prompt 1: "Forecast Q3 revenue"**
‚Ä¢ **What Worked:** Clear and direct.
‚Ä¢ **Suggestion:** Add more context for better results. Try: "Acting as a financial analyst for a fast-growing wine company, forecast Q3 revenue based on the attached sales data (Q1-Q2 2024), considering a 15% summer seasonal lift and a new partnership with Delta launching in July."

**Prompt 2: "Analyze budget variance"**
‚Ä¢ **What Worked:** Good use of a specific term.
‚Ä¢ **Suggestion:** Specify the format for the output. Try adding: "...present the results in a markdown table with columns for Budget, Actual, Variance $, and Variance %."

**Prompt 3: "Explain compliance costs"**
‚Ä¢ **What Worked:** Great, open-ended question for exploration.
‚Ä¢ **Suggestion:** To make it more actionable, add a role. "Explain the main drivers of compliance costs to a new board member who is unfamiliar with the wine industry."

Overall, fantastic start. You're already thinking like a prompt engineer!

Let me know if you have any questions. See you in the next session!

Best,
Aaron

Subject: [URGENT - INTERNAL] Une Femme Risk: Sam's Engagement Dropping

Matt,

Flagging an urgent risk for discussion:

**Issue:** Sam missed today's session and hasn't engaged with platform

**Context:**
- She has fee at risk tied to performance
- Seemed skeptical in Week 1 interview
- No response to 2 follow-up attempts

**Potential Impact:**
- Could influence executive buy-in
- May affect Phase 2 opportunity
- Team morale if exec not participating

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Matt personal outreach today
2. Offer 1:1 catch-up session
3. Share specific ROI data for her area
4. Get Jameca's help if needed

**Deadline:** Need to re-engage before Thursday's demo

Available to discuss strategy.
